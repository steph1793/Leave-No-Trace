:wink: :put_litter_in_its_place: Learning to Reset for Safe and Autonomous Reinforcement Learning

We based our work on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06782). The authors aimed to provide a framework for safe learning, allowing our agent to learn good behaviour (quickly) and run for longer episodes avoiding numerous resets which can be costly.
